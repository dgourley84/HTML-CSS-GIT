            Hi my name is Dallas, I am a finance manager from Brisbane who has been in the finance industry for 15 years. In the last 6-7 years I have noticed that finance has moved from a traditional locally hosted application of MYOB or Quickbooks to the SAAS based services of Xero and other.
            With this move it means that a knowledge of coding and the ability to extract the source data from these applications and merge them with other SAAS systems data – such as timekeeping reports and Azure usage reports – and to visualise in programs such as Tabeleu and PowerBI has opened up a new world of financial analysis.
            I am partaking this course to learn how to best extract, store and update the data through web based applications or installed apps so that I can start to build a more robust and easily updatable reporting suite.
